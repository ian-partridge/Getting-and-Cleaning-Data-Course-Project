## Introduction

As part of the Coursera 'Getting and Cleaning Data Course' a project was 
required to be completed and then peer reviewed. This repo is the submission
requirements for the project. The 'Getting and Cleaning Data Course' was 
developed and maintained by John Hopkins University and project details can be
found at <https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning/peer/FIZtT/getting-and-cleaning-data-course-project>
website.

## Project objectives

1. Create a tidy dataset from the relevant data in the UCI HAR Dataset.
2. Create a R script named 'run_analysis.R' which produces 'tidy_data.txt'.
3. Create a markdown README.md file (this file) and a codebook.md.
4. Create github repository with required files for submission
